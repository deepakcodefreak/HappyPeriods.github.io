When it comes to menstruation the gulf between rural and urban women broadens considerably. While growing up we have seen how menstruation was not a subject that was discussed freely by our teachers and mothers, yet it was a conversation we have all had. With television, the internet and more awareness and education conversations around menstruation have become less inhibited.  However, when it comes to rural areas we see a complete contrast. With the lack of resources, education and awareness about personal hygiene, forgot information about hygiene products the women donâ€™t even have any conversation around menstruation.  Given the taboos surrounding it, it is often seen as dirty and unpleasant and hence, never gets the attention it needs. So what are the challenges rural women face with regard to menstruation? We have made this website for an N.G.O who works for the society and provide awareness to women especially rural women about Menstruation .
